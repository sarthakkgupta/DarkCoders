# DevWeek Submission

Our theme for DevWeek was Post Covid World.
So post covid all the students will be returning to their campuses. Now they will have a lot of things which are not of use to them(like books,equiments for 2nd semester etc). So to solve this problem we created an application in which they can easily put up any item for sale in just 2 steps. And students of the same campus can look up for their required thing and can easily contact the person putting up the item.
